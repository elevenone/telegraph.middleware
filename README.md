# Telegraph Middleware

This package includes the following Telegraph-compatible middleware:

- _ExceptionHandler_ to handle exceptions from subsequent middleware
- _FormContentHandler_ to deserialize the URL-encoded payload of a PSR-7 request
- _JsonContentHandler_ to deserialize the JSON payload of a PSR-7 request
- _ResponseSender_ to send a PSR-7 response
- _SessionHeadersHandler_ to manage session headers "manually", instead of PHP
  managing them automatically

This package is installable and PSR-4 autoloadable via Composer as
`telegraph/middleware`.

## ExceptionHandler

Similarly, the _ExceptionHandler_ does what it sound like: it catches any
exceptions that bubble up through the subsequent middleware decorators.

The _ExceptionHandler_ does nothing with the `$request` or `$response`, and
passes them directly to `$next` inside a `try/catch` block. If no exception
bubbles up, it returns the `$response` from `$next`.  However, if it catches an
exception, it returns an entirely new `$response` object with the exception
message and an HTTP 500 status code. It then returns the new `$response` object.

The _ExceptionHandler_ is intended to go near the top of the Telegraph queue,
but after the _ResponseSender_, so that the _ResponseSender_ can then send the
returned `$response`.

To add the _ExceptionHandler_ to your queue, instantiate it directly with an
empty $response implementation object ...

```php
$queue[] = new \Telegraph\Middleware\ExceptionHandler(new ResponseImplementation());
```

... or use a `$resolver` of your choice to instantiate it from the `$queue`.

## FormContentHandler

_FormContentHandler_ works almost identically to _JsonContentHandler_ (below),
but parses payloads of requests that have `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` as
the `Content-Type`.

## JsonContentHandler

Again, the _JsonContentHandler_ does what it sounds like: it deserializes the
JSON payload of a PSR-7 request object and makes the parameters available in
subsequent middleware decorators.

The _JsonContentHandler_ checks the incoming request for a method other than
`GET` and for an `application/json` or `application/vnd.api+json` `Content-Type`
header. If it finds both of these, it parses the JSON and makes it available as
the _parsed body_ of the `$request` before passing it and the `$response` to
`$next`. If the method is `GET` or the `Content-Type` header defines a different
mime type, the _JsonContentHandler_ ignores the `$request` and continues the
chain.

To add the _JsonContentHandler_ to your queue, instantiate it directly...

```php
$queue[] = new \Telegraph\Middleware\JsonContentHandler();
```

... or use a `$resolver` of your choice to instantiate it from the `$queue`.

To access the decoded parameters in subsequent middleware, use the
`getParsedBody()` method of the `$request`

```php
$decodedJsonData = $request->getParsedBody();
```

## ResponseSender

The _ResponseSender_ does just what it sounds like: it sends the PSR-7 response
object.

The _ResponseSender_ does nothing with the `$request` or `$response`, passing
them immediately to `$next`. Afterwards, it takes the returned `$response` and
sends it using `header()` and `echo`, and returns the sent `$response`.

The _ResponseSender_ is intended to go at the top of the Telegraph queue, so
that it is the middleware with the last opportunity to do something with the
returned response.

To add the _ResponseSender_ to your Telegraph queue, instantiate it directly ...

```php
$queue[] = new \Telegraph\Middleware\ResponseSender();
```

... or use a `$resolver` of your choice to instantiate it from the `$queue`.

## SessionHeadersHandler

Normally, PHP will send out headers for you automatically when you call
`session_start()`. However, this means the headers are not being sent as part of
the PSR-7 response object, and are thus outside your control. This handler puts
them back under your control by placing the relevant headers in the PSR-7
response; its behavior is almost identical to the native PHP automatic session
headers behavior.

> NOTE: For this middleware to work, you **must** disable the PHP session
> header management ini settings. For example:
>
>     ini_set('session.use_trans_sid', false);
>     ini_set('session.use_cookies', false);
>     ini_set('session.use_only_cookies', true);
>     ini_set('session.cache_limiter', '');
>
> If you do not, the handler will throw a RuntimeException.

To add the _SessionHeadersHandler_ to your queue, instantiate it directly...

```php
$queue[] = new \Telegraph\Middleware\SessionHeadersHandler();
```

... or use a `$resolver` of your choice to instantiate it from the `$queue`.

When instantiating, you can pass a
[cache limiter](http://php.net/session_cache_limiter) value as the first
constructor parameter. The allowed values are 'nocache', 'public',
'private_no_cache', or 'priviate'. If you want no cache limiter header at all,
pass an empty string ''. The default is 'nocache'.

You can also pass a [cache expire](http://php.net/session_cache_expire) value,
in minutes, as the second constructor parameter. The default is 180 minutes.
